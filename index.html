                    <h2>#Basic Computer Course</h2>
                    <p style="text-align: center;">The benefits of taking a computer course are many and regardless what the students wants to do with their education, 
                        they will likely find that many benefits come with their increased knowledge. Today, computers are used in more 
                        environments and for more functions than ever before, and their use is only expected to increase. Knowing the inner 
                        workings of a personal computer (PC) will definitely save the user time, and decrease the stress, when they are forced 
                        to interact with a computer at work, or in an informal setting. Knowing the many uses of computers and how to access 
                        them effectively is a valuable skill in today’s world. </p>
                    <p style="text-align: center;">This course is designed for students as well as adults who don't have any prior computer experience to 
                        help them master the basics.</p>

                    <h2>#Data Structures & Algorithms</h2>
                    <p style="text-align: center;">Data structures are a key component of Computer Science and help in understanding the nature of a 
                        given problem at a deeper level. They're widely utilized in Artificial Intelligence, operating systems, graphics, and other fields.
                         Data Structures are typically used to organize, process, retrieve and store data on computers for efficient use.
                        Having the right understanding and using the right data structures helps software engineers write the right code.
                        If the programmer is unfamiliar with data structure and Algorithm, they may be unable to write efficient data-handling code. This course will 
                        not only help you to organize and assemble data but also help you solve real-life problems as well as to apply the proper data structures
                         to write efficient code by managing data properly.

                    <h2>#Python & ML</h2>
                    <p style="text-align: center;">Python is an easy to learn, powerful programming language. You can use Python when your data 
                        analysis tasks need to be integrated with web apps or if statistics code needs to be incorporated into a production 
                        database.
                        There are several Python packages for basic data analysis and machine learning. In this course, you will learn about 
                        popular packages in Python: NumPy and Pandas. These are the essential foundational packages that are required for basic 
                        data manipulation. In this course you will also learn about the most effective machine learning techniques, and gain practice 
                        implementing them and getting them to work for yourself. More importantly, you'll learn about not only the theoretical 
                        underpinnings of learning, but also gain the practical know-how needed to quickly and powerfully apply these techniques
                         to new problems.

                    <h2>#Programming in C & C++</h2>
                    <p style="text-align: center;">If you are looking to develop your skills as a software developer or a computer programmer, the wide variety of 
                        programming languages that exist may overwhelm you and make you wonder which one you should invest in learning. 
                        Though different languages are useful for writing specific types of code, the C programming language is perhaps 
                        the most universal and beneficial. In fact, learning C could help you develop skills that will benefit you throughout 
                        your professional career by simplifying the process of learning additional programming languages in the future.
                        As one of the foundational languages in programming, C is used more widely than other interpreted languages, such as PHP and Ruby.</p> 
                        <p style="text-align: center;">Learning C will take time, but the benefits are worth the effort.</p>
